# **💀🔥 HOW TO JOIN SOLSTICE LABS 🔥💀**  

*(We commit at midnight. We deploy at dawn. Sleep is a myth.)*  

---

### **🚀 STEP 1: BE A LEGEND**  
You think you got what it takes? Prove it. We don’t just want coders—we want **code warlocks** who breathe in syntax and exhile bugs.  

- **You live in VS Code (or Vim, we won’t judge… much).**  
- **You’ve deployed at 3 AM and laughed in the face of broken CI/CD.**  
- **You meme in Markdown and flex in GitHub issues.**  

---

### **🍴 STEP 2: FORK THIS REPO**  
If you can’t fork a repo… *bruh.*  

🔗 **[FORK ME](https://github.com/Solstice-Labs/how-to-apply/fork)**  

*(Bonus points if your fork has a cooler README than ours. We dare you.)*  

---

### **📝 STEP 3: WRITE YOUR APPLICATION**  
Create a file in `/applications/` called:  
**`[YOUR_NAME]_application.md`**  

Include:  
- **Who you are** *(but make it spicy 🌶️)*  
- **What you build** *(GitHub links or GTFO)*  
- **Why you wanna join** *(flattery works. Bribery works better.)*  

*(Extra credit: Embed a meme. Or a GIF. Or a cursed JSON file. Surprise us.)*  

---

### **🚨 STEP 4: OPEN A PULL REQUEST**  
We’ll review it… *eventually.* (We’re nocturnal, remember?)  

**If your PR gets merged?** Welcome to the cult—uh, *team.*  
**If it gets closed?** Skill issue. Try again next solstice.  

---

### **📧 ALTERNATE ROUTE: EMAIL US (IF YOU’RE OLD-SCHOOL)**  
Send your **CV/resume + GitHub/LinkedIn** to:  
📨 **[solstice.labs@yahoo.com](mailto:solstice.labs@yahoo.com)**  

*(Subject line: "I want to join the midnight gang" or risk being ignored.)*  

---

### **🔥 BONUS LEVEL: FLEX HARDER**  
- **Make your PR auto-deploy a meme.**  
- **Write your app in Assembly.** *(We’ll pretend to understand it.)*  
- **Bribe us with coffee.** *(Dark roast. No exceptions.)*  

---

**GOOD LUCK, SOLDIER.**  
May your code compile on the first try.
